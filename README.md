# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust sentiment analysis model for tweets, labeling them as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. It aims to leverage preprocessing techniques, shallow and deep classifiers, ensemble methods, and data augmentation for improved prediction results.

### Business Understanding
Understanding public sentiment on platforms like Twitter is crucial for businesses to gauge opinion, customer feedback, and social sentiment trends. The project aligns with the need to accurately classify tweets into sentiment categories to inform decision-making and improve customer relations.

### Approach
1. **Preprocessing Techniques:**
   - Data augmentation methods.

2. **Model Implementation:**
   - Random Forest (RF).
   - XGBoost.
   - Deep Neural Network
   - Shallow Neural Network

3. **Evaluation:**
   - F-1 measure as the primary evaluation metric.
   - Comparison of various methodologies to enhance sentiment prediction accuracy.

### Outcome
The shallow neural network emerged as the most effective model, achieving a test accuracy of 79.59% and high F1 scores across sentiment categories. The project provides valuable insights into sentiment analysis on Twitter data, contributing to understanding sentiment trends effectively.
